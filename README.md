# Learning-Organise-Objects
Python code for simulating robot organising objects on a cluttered table top.

In this repository, a combined task and motion planner in python is implemented in OpenRave. In the simulation, different objects have been placed randomly on a table top. The KUKA LWR arm is able to organise these objects to some specific final configurations only using Pick&Place. The algorithm implemented generates a suitable action sequence for manipulating the objects, an RRT motion planner is implemented in this stage. A LfD technique will be applied later on.

Run the file: python/Yue/Yues_Experiment_Demo.py, the simulation will start.

If you have any question, just let me know.
